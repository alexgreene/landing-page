			<h2>Future Predictions</h2>
			<h4>by <a href="index.html" class='hili hili-yellow'> Alexander&nbsp;Greene</a></h4>

			<p>At some point in 2019, I decided to spend a little bit of each morning commute thinking about what the future might look like. I broke the process down into a several categories and told myself to just write whatever came to mind. Here's the (unfinished, and un-edited) result:</p>

			<h2>The future of transportation</h2>
<p>Private transportation will always be available, but will be less encompassing and specialized for road trips, exploration, and enjoyment. Commuting privately by automobile will not be the cheapest nor the most efficient option. For commute not covered by a transit line, owners will make seats in their ride accessible, and this will be an acceptable, safe, and common practice for riders. Buses and other large occupancy vehicles will own private lanes, so they’ll be extremely efficient. Routes may adjust based on traffic and/or riders pickup/destination. Last mile transit from major public stations will include a variety of vehicles, including ride-share vehicles that bus based on common destinations. Traffic signals will be entirely connected, so they can optimize based on events far upstream. Public transit could be enjoyable. Why can’t I buy food on the train? </p>

<h2>The future of home</h2>
<p>Locking doors will not be a thing, because my house will know its me and just let me in. I can give permission to other people as well. Perhaps if I say a code word or make a gesture, that will be the second layer of identification. Or the presence of my mobile device. Garbage will be sorted very specifically, recycling will be more of a requirement, perhaps with tax implications. Food waste will be reduced by easier allowing food sharing. If you have something that you will not eat, share it. Grey water will be recycled for lawn-care and then sent back to the community for recycling.  Furniture will become increasingly multi-purpose or modular. Chairs that hideaway, etc. </p>

<h2>The future of food</h2>
<p>Less packaging
A machine that can take raw ingredients and prepare a meal. The cost and maintenance might require they be available at the neighborhood/community level at first, either in eateries or shared spaces, but they will eventually make their way into the kitchen. 
What if you stored your dishes in the dishwasher? Put your dirty dishes in as if you were putting them back in the cabinet. Open top of counter. Growing vegetables in automated fashion. Akin to Farmbot but cheaper. If the entire neighborhood had a set of Farmbots, the buy in would be low. If I grow tomatoes in my backyard, I’ll have more than I can possibly eat. They also have way more taste and are potentially healthier for you. Farmers markets with communities. Perhaps even at the neighborhood level. I commit the leftover yield from my tomato plant to the neighborhood food pantry. One of the most neighborly acts is giving fruits or vegetables to your neighbors. 
Better understanding of the chemistry that make certain foods and combinations of foods taste good, especially at an individual level. If you can understand your taste profile, a restaurant would be able to make your salad or burger taste better, they recipes you browser would be more finely filtered, and you’d enjoy more the food you eat.
</p>

<h2>The future of entertainment</h2>
<p>Fully immersive experiences that can be enjoyed with friends locally or across the globe. Not from within your home, but at specialized entertainment centers, movie theaters. Akin to Laser Tag, VR experiences of today. Smart games that can form personalized experiences for each player. Games that require true cooperation and coordination between multiple players. The ability for players to build extremely personalized environments. If I picture a snowy mediaeval village in my head, my only chances of exploring it are by closing my eyes and trying to imagine it, or funding a AAA title with tens of millions of dollars to see the world realized. In the future, I expect the truly imaginative generative worlds to be what allows players to share experiences with each other. Minecraft is a perfect example of what this means to people. But imagine you could imagine new experiences inside of minecraft. Playing games with strangers over the internet is fully accepted, but nothing pulls you to know that person. Playing games with strangers in real life in public spaces will be acceptable and encourages. Public gaming spaces. Imagine a section on the train where people are playing cards. Watching sports/events with people remotely will be immersive.</p>

<h2>The future of communication</h2>
<p>Your friends can be halfway around the world but you’ll be able to interact with them as if they are in the same house</p>

<h2>The future of healthcare</h2>
<p>Every visit to the doctor is logged on a private but accessible log that you have control of and can share with detailed permissions.
You’ll be able to monitor everything of interest to your health. The air quality you breathe, the food you eat, the liquids you drink and shits you take. Track when you are tired, annoyed, dizzy, hungry, everything. This will plug into a public graph to better understand collective and individual health. Your entire healthcare routine will be tracked on an app. You can see your appointments, make appointments, share data, pay, signup and choose different plans.</p>

<h2>The future of community</h2>

<h2>The future of learning</h2>

<h2>The future of work</h2>
