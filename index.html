		<p>Alex has a number of interests including public transportation, education, food, government, small businesses, real estate, using space efficiently, interior design, sustainability, baseball, maps, online communities, hand lettering, neighborhoods, personal tracking, automation, handmade things, making meaningful things, religion, investing, sketching, optimizing meaningful systems, nostolgia, RPGs, sign searching, old well designed things, gardening, systems design, and figuring out who he is.</p> 


		<p>In fact, keeping track of things is a common theme in Alexander's life. He's logged (nearly) every movie he's watched over the past 10 years, journals the dreams he can remember, and for 1 whole month, recorded everything he wore. </p>
