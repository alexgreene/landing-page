		<p>You've scrolled down far enough to suggest that you're truly interested in learning more about me. Well, thank you ____, I'm flattered! </p>


		<p>My time is often spent indoor gardening, and reorganizing the things in my studio so that I have space for... indoor gardening. In many ways I am idealistic, and I'm fascinated by the idea of everyone growing some portion of the food they eat. I've recently taken up experimenting with fermentation, and now have a regular supply of fermented foods and beverages in the kitchen. 

		<p>One of my favorite hobbies is something I call sign searching. If you spend time with me, some of the things you'll hear me say at some point are:</p>

		<blockquote>Wow! Look at that sign!</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Now that's beautiful lettering...</blockquote>


		<p>Which is to say, if we're walking outside and pass by a beautiful (old) sign, I'm likely to gaze adoringly at it for several seconds, before snapping a picture.</p>


		<div class="illustration"></div>

		<!-- <blockquote></blockquote> -->

		<p>Alex has a number of interests including public transportation, education, food, government, small businesses, real estate, using space efficiently, interior design, sustainability, baseball, maps, online communities, hand lettering, neighborhoods, personal tracking, automation, handmade things, making meaningful things, religion, investing, sketching, optimizing meaningful systems, nostolgia, RPGs, sign searching, old well designed things, gardening, systems design, and figuring out who he is.</p> 


		<p>In fact, keeping track of things is a common theme in Alexander's life. He's logged (nearly) every movie he's watched over the past 10 years, journals the dreams he can remember, and for 1 whole month, recorded everything he wore. </p>
